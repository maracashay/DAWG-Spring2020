# DAWG-Spring2020

We are continuing to work with the dataset from Fall-2019 from Dr. Howrylak. 

Frist, we will make inferences about genetic potential in the samples by using PICRUSt2. Then we will perform statistics on the resulting output files.

Then, we will move on to including metabolomic data into our analyses. Dr. Howrylak has paired metabolomic data to go with the amplicon data.
