This tutorial will talk through hypothesis testing for alpha diversity indices using the functions `betta` and `betta_random`. 

## Disclaimer

*Disclaimer*: If you have not taken a introductory statistics class or devoted serious time to learning introductory statistics, I strongly encourage you to reconsider doing so before ever quoting a p-value or doing modeling of any kind. An introductory statistics class will teach you valuable skills that will serve you well throughout your entire scientific career, including the use and abuse of p-values in science, how to responsibly fit models and test null hypotheses, and an appreciation for how easy it is to inflate the statistical significance of a result. Please equip yourself with the statistical skills and scepticism necessary to responsibly test and discuss null hypothesis significance testing.

## Preliminaries

Download the latest version of the package from github.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("adw96/breakaway")
library(tidyverse)
library(breakaway)
library(magrittr)
library(phyloseq)
```

Let's use the Whitman et al dataset from `corncob` as our example.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("bryandmartin/corncob")
library(corncob)
data("soil_phylo")
soil_phylo %>% sample_data %>% head #same as head(sample_data(soil_phylo))
```

I'm only going to consider samples amended with biochar, and I want to look at the effect of `Day`. This will tell us how much diversity in the soil changed from Day 0 to Day 82. (Just to be confusing, Day 82 is called Day 2 in the dataset.)

```{r}
subset_soil <- soil_phylo %>%
  subset_samples(Amdmt == 1) %>% # only biochar
  subset_samples(Day %in% c(0, 2))  # only Days 0 and 82
```

I now run breakaway on these samples to get richness estimates, and plot them.

```{r}
richness_soil <- subset_soil %>% breakaway
plot(richness_soil, physeq=subset_soil, color="Day", shape = "ID")
```

Don't freak out! Those are wide error bars, but nothing went wrong -- it's just really hard to estimate the true number of unknown species in soil. `breakaway` was developed to deal with this, and to make sure that we account for that uncertainty when we do inference.

We can get a table of the estimates and their uncertainties as follows:

```{r}
summary(richness_soil) %>% as_tibble
```

If you haven't seen a `tibble` before, it's like a `data.frame`, but way better. Already we can see that we only have 10 rows printed as opposed to the usual bagillion.

## Inference

The first step to doing inference is to decide on your design matrix. We need to grab our covariates into a data frame (or tibble), so let's start by doing that:

```{r}
meta <- subset_soil %>%
  sample_data %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  mutate("sample_names" = subset_soil %>% sample_names )
```

That warning is not a problem -- it's just telling us that it's not a phyloseq object anymore.

Suppose we want to fit the model with Day as a fixed effect. Here's how we do that,

```{r}
combined_richness <- meta %>%
  left_join(summary(richness_soil),
            by = "sample_names")
bt_day_fixed <- betta(chats = combined_richness$estimate,
                      ses = combined_richness$error,
                      X = model.matrix(~Day, data = combined_richness))
bt_day_fixed$table
```

So we see an estimated increase in richness after 82 days of 122 taxa, with the standard error in the estimate of 171. A hypothesis test for a change in richness would *not be rejected* at any reasonable cut-off (p = 0.475).

Alternatively, we could fit the model with plot ID as a random effect. Here's how we do that:

```{r}
bt_day_fixed_id_random <- betta_random(chats = combined_richness$estimate,
                                       ses = combined_richness$error,
                                       X = model.matrix(~Day, data = combined_richness),
                                       groups=combined_richness$ID)
bt_day_fixed_id_random$table
```

Under this different model, we see an estimated increase in richness after 82 days of 234 taxa, with the standard error in the estimate of 163. A hypothesis test for a change in richness still would *not be rejected* at any reasonable cut-off (p = 0.153).

The overall structure of `betta` and `betta_random` is to input your design matrix as `X`, and your random effects as `groups`, where the latter is a categorical variable.

A future version of breakaway hopes to make this interface easier to use a more familiar to users of `lme4` and other mixed effects models. If this is late 2020 and it's not done, please come and find me (Amy) and make me feel embarrassed.

# Using `betta` with DivNet

Maybe you don't care about richness... but you care about Shannon or Simpson diversity! [`DivNet`](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet) is our `R` package for estimating Shannon and Simpson diversity.

```{r, include=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("adw96/DivNet")
library(DivNet)
```

DivNet can be slow when you have a large number of taxa (but we are working on it!), so to illustrate we are going to estimate phylum-level Shannon diversity:

```{r}
soil_phylum <- subset_soil %>%
  tax_glom(taxrank="Phylum")
```

Easter egg: `phyloseq::tax_glom` can be incredibly slow! [Mike McLaren](https://github.com/mikemc) is a total champ and rewrote it faster -- check out his package [`speedyseq`](https://github.com/mikemc/speedyseq) and `speedyseq::tax_glom` in particular.

Let's treat all samples as independent observations (`X = NULL`) and fit the DivNet model:

(Check out the full documentation for details, including how to run in parallel)

```{r, include=TRUE, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
dv <- DivNet::divnet(soil_phylum, X = NULL)
```

This produces an object containing common diversity estimates:

```{r}
dv
```

We can look at the first few Shannon diversity estimates with the following:

```{r}
combined_shannon <- meta %>%
  left_join(dv$shannon %>% summary,
            by = "sample_names")
combined_shannon
```

You might notice that the estimates are not different from the plug-in estimate (only because we used `X = NULL`), but we have standard errors! That's the real advantage of using DivNet :)


```{r}
bt_day_fixed_id_random <- betta_random(chats = combined_shannon$estimate,
                                       ses = combined_shannon$error,
                                       X = model.matrix(~Day, data = combined_shannon),
                                       groups=combined_shannon$ID)
bt_day_fixed_id_random$table
```

and similarly for no random effects.

And there you have it! That's how to do hypothesis testing for diversity!
